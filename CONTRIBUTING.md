## Set up your local development environment

The `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` repo is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

To develop and test the `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` package:

1. Fork the `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device.

2. Ensure using the latest Node.js (16.14+)

3. `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` uses pnpm v8. If you are working on multiple projects with different versions of pnpm, it's recommend to enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) by running `corepack enable`.

4. Check out a branch where you can work and commit your changes:
```shell
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

5. Run `pnpm i` in `@vite-pwa/sveltekit`'s root folder

6. Run `pnpm run build` in `@vite-pwa/sveltekit`'s root folder.

## Testing changes

To test your changes locally, change to `examples/sveltekit-ts` folder and run `pnpm run build-<example> && pnpm run preview` where `<example>` is the name of the example you want to test.

## Running tests

Before running tests, you'll need to install [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) Chromium browser: `pnpm playwright install chromium`.

Run `pnpm run test` in `@vite-pwa/sveltekit`'s root folder or inside `examples/sveltekit-ts` folder after build `@vite-pwa/sveltekit`.
